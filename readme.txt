== Description ==

Automatically post content related to any topic of your choice to your weblog.

== Installation ==
Upload the plugin to your website. You can either do this by using a FTP program (for example the free Filezilla). Extract the WP Robot zip file you received after purchasing with a software like the free 7-zip first and then upload the whole "WPRobot" folder from the .zip file to the "/wp-content/plugins" folder of your Wordpress installation.

Alternatively you can upload the .zip file directly with the Wordpress internal plugin uploader. You can find it on the "Add New" screen in your Wordpress admin area (located under "Plugins > Add New"). Once you are there simply click on "Upload" at the top, select the WP Robot zip file on your hard disk and finally click "Install Now".

Activate "WP Robot" on the "Plugins" page of your Wordpress admin area. If you uploaded WP Robot with the internal Wordpress installer you can simply click on the "Activate" link you get on the second page.
